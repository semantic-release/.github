# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-11-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we take steps to modernize CI and dependency updating, @gr2m and @travi have taken steps to discuss trade-offs of various options. During these discussions, the value of capturing the decisions from these discussions came up. Interest from both of us in ADRs was mentioned.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
